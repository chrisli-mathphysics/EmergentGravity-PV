# EmergentGravity-PV
This Github repository contains the Mathematica notebooks used for some of the computations performed for Composite Gravity with Pauli-Villars Fields. 

PVscheme3_general_fixed.nb: Contains the computation of the kernel and a, b, V_0 for the $ q \neq 0 $ case, with k=3 sets of Pauli-Villars fields. The statistical weights $ \alpha_{1,2,3} $ were determined by hand. The notebook first computes the kernel and then determines a, b, and V_0.

PVscheme3_alpha4.nb: Contains the computation of the kernel and a, b, V_0 for the $ q \neq 0 $ case, with k=4 sets of Pauli-Villars fields. This notebook is very similar to PVscheme3_general_fixed.nb. The notebook first computes the four statistical weights $ \alpha_{1,2,3,4} $, and then proceeds to compute the kernel, and lastly determines a, b, and V_0.
